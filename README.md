# Archer 

--|An accurate point in the right direction|--

The Archer App project was created on July 12 2021 as a fullstack excersize by Alyna Palamarchuk, Brittany Fisher and Joshua Simon.

The purpose of Archer is to provide reviews of local parks, campgrounds and adventure resorts.

An image of the homepage can be found below:

Archer was inspired by travel websites, but distinguished from the norm with its blog-like feel. 
The organization of this project was tracked via Zoom, Slack and Trello.

During the construction of this app, the group learned to work jointly and independently.

The group utilized Trello to define tasks, github for code organization/merging and Zoom for screen sharing.

Archer, as pictured above, relies on Boostrap for it's front-end styling.

Future implementation would include API's to track weather activities for booking travelers, like/dislike features in reviews and map API's.
